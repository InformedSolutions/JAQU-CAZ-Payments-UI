        The

        is operated by the Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU),
        a team established jointly between the Department for Environment,
        Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport (DfT).

        The purpose of the
        = service_name
        is to enable you to pay to enter a Clean Air Zone.
      %p
        To use
        = service_name
        charge you need to enter a vehicle registration mark (VRM).
        JAQU treats VRMs as personal data because DVLA, which is an executive agency of DfT,
        is able to identify registered keepers from VRMs.
        However, the VRM you enter will only be retained in the Vehicle Checker for 24 hours
        after your enquiry has been answered
        and will not be accessible in any way by JAQU, DfT and Defra,
        or shared with any other organisation.

      %p
        You can raise any queries about the information provided by
        = service_name

                    id: 'vccs-contact-form-link')
        Along with your query, you will need to give your name and email address,
        which will be used to respond to you.
        Information, including your name and email address,
        that you send using the webform will not be kept by

          = service_name
        but Gov.Notify will send the information to JAQU,
        or another organisation acting on JAQU’s behalf, to respond to you.
        Your personal information will be kept for no longer than a year and then deleted.

        The processing of personal data in
