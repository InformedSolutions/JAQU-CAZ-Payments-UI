    %p If the date you want to pay for is not displayed, it may be because:
    - if @d_day_notice
      %ul
        %li
          The Clean Air Zone charge came into operation on #{parse_single_date(@charge_start_date)}.
    - else
      %ul
        %li
          It is after 11.59pm on the 6th day after you drove in.
          %p You may be subject to a penalty charge notice (PCN).
    %ul
      %li
        The date is too far in the future.
        %p You should check back here closer to the date you want
